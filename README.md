# NerdQuest, a Cocoa adventure.

I'd like to think this code is elegant, but who knows what elegance is anymore?

## Some glowing testimonials:

"NerdQuest, the Cocoa app, was the worst NerdQuest client. in the history of the United States. NerdQuest Cocoa was the worst. In the history of the United States there’s never been a NerdQuest client so bad as NerdQuest Cocoa.”

“If you really love this country you have a very, very hard time convincing people that what you’re doing is right and that you’re really smart. And, like, a lot of us are really smart. I’m really smart, but NerdQuest Cocoa isn't.”

"Database corruption? I’ll keep you in suspense, OK?"

"If NerdQuest Cocoa is hurting people, & it is, why shouldn't it hurt soundsmitten's reputation companies & why should Congress not be paying what public pays?"

"Only NerdQuest Cocoa's race conditions want me to stop using Social Media (110 million people). Only way for me to get the truth out!"
